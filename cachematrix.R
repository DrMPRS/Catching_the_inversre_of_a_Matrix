makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) { ##Creation of the function "makeCacheMatrix", that creates a special matrix that can cache its inverse.

}


## Write a short comment describing this function

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
} ##in "cacheSolve" if the inverse has already been calculated, cachesolve can retrieve the inverse from the cache, otherwise if the inverse has not been calculated, data gets the matrix stored with makeCacheMatrix, m calculates the inverse, and x$setmean(z) stores it in the object z in makeCacheMatrix.
